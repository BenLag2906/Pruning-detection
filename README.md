A useful way to optimize time of processing with minimum of loss in accuracy is tu prun a model.

In the folling python code, a way to divide time processing without a real loss in accuracy.

By apply this function on yolov8 model ( based on Pytorch and .pt), we obtain similar time processing as tensorRT framework.
